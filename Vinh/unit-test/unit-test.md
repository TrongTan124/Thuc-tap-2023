## Test-driven development (TDD)

- write tests before the python application is implemented.
- which means the tests should fail when they are executed => reduce the likelihood of false positive results.
- verfying the code specification since other people ouside of the group writing tests
  This will keep the code bases in check all the time.

First, need to create an env environment.

```python

python -m venv .venv
```

Next, install pandas to read data from the file into a data frame

```python
pip install pandas
```
